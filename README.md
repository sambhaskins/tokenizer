# GPT-Style Tokenizer

## Overview

The GPT-Style Tokenizer is a Python tool designed to tokenize text data in a manner similar to the tokenization process used in models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). Tokenization is the process of breaking down a piece of text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens serve as the basic units of input for natural language processing models.

This tokenizer aims to replicate the tokenization approach used in GPT models, where tokens are typically created by splitting the input text on spaces and special characters, while also preserving important linguistic elements such as punctuation and emojis.

## Features

- **GPT-style Tokenization**: The tokenizer breaks down input text into tokens following a methodology similar to GPT models, ensuring compatibility with GPT-based applications.
- **Unicode Support**: The tokenizer handles text data containing Unicode characters, including emojis and special symbols.
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Text input is encoded into UTF-8 format before tokenization, ensuring compatibility with various text encodings.
- **Integer Token Representation**: Tokens are represented as integers, facilitating efficient storage and processing in machine learning applications.
